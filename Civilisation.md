#Civilisation

What it is, how it changes over time, how it interacts with the outside world.

##Overall idea

* Consider noisy IPD with evolution and neigbours.
* Civilisation is the tit-for-tat cluster of strategies. 
* Barbrism is the always defect cluster.
* At the boundary barbarism wins.
* At the center of the civilisation cluster civilisation creates enough utility to grow.

##Second order effects

* Inside the civilisation cluster tit for n tats is a better strategy for larger n.
* Near the boundary this is a worse strategy.
* If players migrate that makes the boundary larger.
* Green beard effects are important.
