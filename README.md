# Ideas

Some thoughts in the form of a github project showing history etc. Origional idea is from Raymond Arnold at https://www.facebook.com/raymond.arnold.5/posts/10206296955916806?pnref=story.

## Meta

Most of this will be specific small topics rather than grand ideas and projects. And I've no idea how long I'll keep it up. But it could be fun to try. And it'd be really facinating to see people fork it.


##Format

Each file is an MD document in three sections:

* introduction - title and few sentences of background
* body - h2 titles to the key ideas in the topic
* Facts beleifs - A list of propositions (varifiable or not, fact s and values both fine) that seem relevant in this contex and their probabilities.

#Facts/beleifs
